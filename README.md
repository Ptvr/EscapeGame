# 🔐 EscapeGame – Unreal Engine 5 Multiplayer Prototype

This project was one of my **first experiments with multiplayer gameplay**, made with **Unreal Engine 5** using **Blueprints**.  
It’s a **cooperative escape game** for two players, inspired by *We Were Here*, where communication and teamwork are essential to solve puzzles and progress through the levels. 

Developed as a **two-student project**, it also included the production of a **short trailer**, showcasing the atmosphere and mechanics of the game a first step for us into presenting our work like a professional studio.

## Concept

The goal of this prototype was to explore **multiplayer mechanics** and **cooperative puzzle design** within Unreal Engine 5.  
Two players experience different perspectives and must share clues to escape each room.

This project later evolved into a **single-player reinterpretation** focused on atmosphere and puzzle design, which became my next project:  
🎭 **[The Grand Masquerade](#)** – a solo puzzle experience inspired by this prototype.
